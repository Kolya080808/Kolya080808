## _Let me tell you a bit about me:_

My name is Nikolai Kravtsov. I am `time.localtime() - time.striptime(“Mon, 8 Aug 2008 00:15:00”,"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S)` years old. From early childhood I loved physics, astronomy and expressed the strongest interest in programs, or rather in their root - “How do they work?”, “Why do they work?” - these were very interesting questions for me. From the age of 10 I started to learn the basics of ethical hacking - UNIX-systems, servers, basic distributions and the simplest vulnerabilities. From 12 I started learning Python, and I learned it to the level of “I can write something myself” literally in a day, and to the level of “I can solve simple tasks from interviews” in two weeks. 

So now I'm here, on [github](https://t.me/bezhopasnik), telling you who I am and why I'm here (*by the way! my brother-fullstack is making a portfolio site for our team, though it won't be soon, but wait ¯\_(ツ)_/¯*). 

### Also something that i need to say (~no~):

## _Now about what I know:_

### Briefly languages ​​and skills in general:

I am learning C++, I can already write programs for Arduino and for hacking, I know C worse, but I can write a simple program, I know python very well. I can read Assembly.

Well, and also English, Spanish and French a bit :)

I can work with some frameworks for hackers, and I can also explain the TCP/IP model and the difference with OSI.

### What can I do in the field of information security?

I know LPE, Web, forensics at an excellent level, I know a little bit of PWN, reverse engineering a little better, I am able to solve cryptography problems at a good level.

### Where do I train and what do I use?

I use Windows 10 22h2 and WSL Kali Linux, I want to switch to Arch, but I'm too lazy to relearn and transfer data..)
I have an account on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/Kolya080808), [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/users/n1ko123), [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/users/2131650). I practice most on thm, but pico also has good tasks. I solve something on HackTheBox only if there is nothing interesting on the other websites i've mentioned before.

## ~P.S.:~

Although, I would say that I am still quite weak in information security, but looking at the telegram channel history before this message, you can say that I have advanced quite far in 3-4 months. In any case, I will continue to learn to solve more complex problems and constantly improve!

If you have any questions, or I forgot to add something about myself, write in the comments, I will do it)
